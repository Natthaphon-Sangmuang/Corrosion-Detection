This project employs three methods for corrosion detection: a non-machine learning approach using color detection, as well as two machine learning techniquesâ€”object detection and object segmentation.

For the dataset, we utilized Roboflow to label images sourced from the internet for both object detection and segmentation. The object detection method was trained using CNN and YOLOv8-nano, while the object segmentation was also trained with YOLOv8-nano.
